# Coursera Capstone


This repository is in part dedicated to the Applied Data Science capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. It also includes a useful tool developed for scraping of the Trip advisor website for restaurant information for a given city. Feel free to try it out and adapt it for your own projects.
